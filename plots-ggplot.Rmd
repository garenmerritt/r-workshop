# Plots with ggplot2

We are going to make plots in R and it's going to be fantastic.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(here)
```


```{r}
ca_np <- read_csv(here("data", "ca.np.csv"))
```


Creating different plots of varying colors, shapes, and sizes based on variable(s).

```{r}
 gg_base + geom_point(color = "salmon2", size = 3)
 gg_base +
 geom_point()
 gg_base +
 geom_point(aes(size = visitors, color = visitors), alpha = 0.5)
 gg_base + geom_col(aes(fill = visitors))
```
